[opening]
Good morning/afternoon, everyone!
My name is Ajax, does anyone know the meaning of my English name?
In fact, it's a shorthand for 'Asynchronous JavaScript And XML', a information technical noun.
Also, it's one of the most famous football team in Holland.

[title]
OK, today, I am going to talk about my work and my goal.

[position]
I am a web front-end development engineer.
Many people think this position belongs to a web designer, but in fact it belongs to a programmer.
So, I can use English frequently when I am coding or reading some foreign documents.

[schedule]
In my daily work, I usually start my work at 9:00 a.m. and I finish my work at 6:00 p.m..
I am not a workaholic, because I like to work efficiently during the working hours rather than work overtime.
I work 6 days a week, I usually go to bed at 11:30 p.m. and I get up at 6:00 a.m. from Monday to Saturday.

[skills]
I usually develop some HTML websites or WeChat mini-programs for our company.
My job duties are developing some user-friendly interfaces, requesting data from server, receiving responses and rendering data to different kinds of platforms.
For example, in our Meten App, the front is the user interface that we can operate, maybe its style looks elegant, cute or cool.
But the data comes from the back, we can't see it, so I think the front-end is more interesting for me.
I have mastered many famous programming languages, such as Java, JavaScript and Python.
I also understand some knowledge about database operations, network protocol and artificial intelligence.

[goal]
The first goal of my career is to accumulate more experience and get a salary of more than 15,000 yuan a month.
I have to keep learning and researching many new technologies, always overcome difficulties.
Sunday is my day off, but I don't really like to get up very late.
I will try my best to study English well and meet more friends at Meten.

[ending]
That's all! Thanks for your listening!
